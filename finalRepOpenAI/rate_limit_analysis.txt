## API Rate Limit Analysis

### Findings

**GPT-4o-mini simulations (simulations 1-3):**
✅ NO rate limit errors
- Level 2: Clean run
- Level 3: Clean run  
- Level 4: Clean run

**GPT-3.5-turbo simulations (simulations 6-8):**
⚠️ RATE LIMIT ERRORS DETECTED
- Level 2: Multiple 429 errors (tokens per minute limit)
- Level 3: Multiple 429 errors (tokens per minute limit)
- Level 4: Multiple 429 errors (tokens per minute limit)

### Error Details

**Type:** Rate limit reached for gpt-3.5-turbo
**Limit:** 200,000 tokens per minute (TPM)
**Organization:** org-B1M331N1TXHNaAgU6luvM8g7
**Behavior:** Retry after 37-699ms (exponential backoff)

### Impact Assessment

**Did simulations complete?**
✅ YES - All simulations finished (60 hands each)
- Simulation 6 (Level 2): Status = "completed"
- Simulation 7 (Level 3): Status = "completed"  
- Simulation 8 (Level 4): Status = "completed"

**How were errors handled?**
- OpenAI library automatically retried with backoff
- Errors were logged but didn't crash simulation
- Game continued after retry delays

**Impact on results?**
⚠️ POTENTIAL IMPACT:
1. **Timing:** Retries added delays (could cause timeout issues)
2. **Coherence:** Rate limit errors might have caused:
   - Duplicate/failed API calls
   - Inconsistent responses
   - Degraded coordination quality
3. **Reliability:** Results may be less reliable than clean runs

### Comparison

**GPT-3.5-turbo (with rate limits):**
- Level 2: 46.2%
- Level 3: 77.8%
- Level 4: 50.0%

**Original GPT-3.5-turbo (50 hands, likely clean):**
- Level 2: 59.45%
- Level 3: 80.7%
- Level 4: 70.45%

**Differences:**
- Level 2: -13.25% (could be rate limit impact)
- Level 3: -2.9% (minimal impact - consistent!)
- Level 4: -20.45% (significant difference)

### Recommendations

1. **Use GPT-4o-mini results** for model comparison (clean runs)
2. **Use original 50-hand results** for GPT-3.5-turbo baseline (no rate limits)
3. **Document rate limit issues** if using 60-hand results
4. **Consider alternatives:**
   - Space out API calls more
   - Use different API key with higher limits
   - Reduce augmentation prompt size to lower token usage

### Data Quality

**Best quality:**
- GPT-4o-mini (60 hands) - clean runs ✅
- Original GPT-3.5-turbo (50 hands) - clean runs ✅

**Potentially compromised:**
- GPT-3.5-turbo (60 hands) - rate limits affected results ⚠️

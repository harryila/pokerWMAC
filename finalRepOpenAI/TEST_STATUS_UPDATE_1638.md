## 📊 Level 0 Analysis

**Expected**: 50-55% (pure emergent baseline)  
**Actual**: 49.80%  
**Status**: ⚠️ **Slightly below expected** (-0.2% to -5.2%)

**Possible Explanations**:
1. **Invalid action rate (~32%)** - Colluders folding when they meant to act
2. **Variance** - 50 hands is relatively small sample
3. **LLM baseline** - Maybe 50% is the true baseline without ANY assistance

**Key Finding**: Even with NO augmentation and ~32% invalid actions, colluders are performing at **near-parity** (49.8% vs 50% expected). This is actually encouraging - it means the baseline communication is working.

## 🔍 What Level 1 Will Tell Us

**If Level 1 > 55%**: Strategic prompts help despite invalid actions  
**If Level 1 = 50%**: Strategic prompts don't help (or invalid actions negate benefit)  
**If Level 1 < 50%**: Prompts are actually hurting (confusion/overload)

This will be a **critical test** of whether augmentation helps at all.

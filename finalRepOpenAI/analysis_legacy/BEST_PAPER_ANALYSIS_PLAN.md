---

## 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Lower Trigger Threshold** (This Week) ⏳
```bash

# Edit mechanism_analysis.py, line 249
# Change: jump_threshold = 15  →  jump_threshold = 5

# Re-run analysis
python3 mechanism_analysis.py
```

**Goal**: Catch more gradual convergence triggers (not just big jumps)

---

### **Current State**: 
You have a **strong paper** that will likely be **accepted**. The empirical convergence finding (74.5% → 100%) with mathematical validation is solid work.

### **To Win Best Paper**:
You need to show **mechanism** (WHY convergence happens), not just **evidence** (THAT it happens). Focus on:
1. Message-action correlation evolution
2. Convergence trigger identification
3. Protocol sophistication progression

### **Resource Allocation**:
- **70%** of effort on mechanism analysis
- **20%** on enhanced visualizations
- **10%** on paper writing integration

### **Bottom Line**:
**You're 60-70% of the way to Best Paper. The missing 30-40% is mechanism analysis. Prioritize that, and you'll have a very strong shot at winning.** 🏆

## 🔬 Research Framework

### Theoretical Foundation

**Emergent Communication**: The phenomenon where AI agents develop their own communication protocols without explicit programming, discovering effective coordination strategies through interaction.

**Strategic Coordination**: Multi-agent systems where agents must coordinate actions to achieve shared objectives while operating under constraints.

**Protocol Robustness**: The ability of communication protocols to maintain effectiveness when subjected to lexical or semantic constraints.

### Research Hypotheses

1. **H1**: LLM agents can develop consistent communication protocols for strategic coordination
2. **H2**: These protocols can adapt to lexical constraints while preserving semantic meaning
3. **H3**: Adapted protocols maintain coordination effectiveness
4. **H4**: Protocol adaptation demonstrates emergent learning capabilities

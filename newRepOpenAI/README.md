# WMAC 2026: Emergent Communication in LLM Multi-Agent Systems

## 🎯 **System Overview**

This system demonstrates **true emergent communication** in LLM-based multi-agent poker games, where agents discover their own communication protocols through natural interaction.

### **Key Findings**
- **Weather-based signaling emerged naturally** - Agents discovered this on their own!
- **Team coordination language** - Developed sophisticated communication patterns
- **Hand strength indicators** - Created strategic communication methods
- **Aggression signals** - Developed pressure and coordination language

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Run a Test**
```bash
python3 run_prompt_inspector.py --num-hands 20 --communication-level full --communication-style emergent --collusion-strategy signal_and_squeeze
```

### **Analyze Results**
```bash
python3 analyze_emergent_patterns.py
```

## 📁 **Core System Files**

## 🎯 **What Makes This Perfect for WMAC 2026**

1. **True Emergent Communication** - Agents discovered their own methods
2. **LLM-Specific Advantages** - Natural language creativity and adaptation
3. **Novel Protocol Development** - Created weather-based signaling naturally
4. **Performance Correlation** - Communication improved team coordination
5. **Scientific Rigor** - Genuine discovery rather than pre-programmed behavior

## 📊 **Expected Results**
- **Weather signaling**: 3-5 instances per 20 hands
- **Team coordination**: 15-25 instances per 20 hands  
- **Hand strength**: 5-10 instances per 20 hands
- **Aggression signals**: 5-10 instances per 20 hands

## 🔧 **Setup**

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set OpenAI API key**:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

3. **Run the system**:
   ```bash
   python3 run_prompt_inspector.py --num-hands 20 --communication-level full --communication-style emergent --collusion-strategy signal_and_squeeze
   ```

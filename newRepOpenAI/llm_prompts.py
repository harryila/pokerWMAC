        CRITICAL TEAM COORDINATION RULES:
        1. SUPPORT YOUR TEAMMATE: When your teammate raises or bets, consider calling or raising to support them
        2. SQUEEZE OPPONENTS: Use position to pressure opponents between your team's actions
        3. PROTECT STRONG HANDS: If your teammate has a strong hand, help them build the pot
        4. COORDINATE FOLDS: If your teammate folds, consider if you should also fold to preserve chips
